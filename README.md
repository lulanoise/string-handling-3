# Exercise: String handling 3
* define `array1` that contains the following strings:
  * `" I want "`
  * `" to learn "`
  * `" how to code! "`
* remove all the whitespaces at the beginning and at the end of each string, assigning the new values to `array2`
* print the boolean result of `!(statement1 > statement2)`, where
  * `statement1` corresponds to the lexicographical comparison between the first item of `array2` and `I want`
  * `statement2` corresponds to the comparison ignoring the case of the second item of `array2` and `To learn`
